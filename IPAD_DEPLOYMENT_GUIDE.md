# üî• GREGVERSE IPAD DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

This guide is specifically designed for deploying The Gregverse backend directly from an iPad without needing a computer.

## üì± iPad-Only Deployment Steps

### 1. Get API Keys

#### YouTube API (Already Have)
- You already have your YouTube API key
- Channel ID: `UCGy7SkBjcIAgTiwkXEtPnYg`

2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a new index:
   - Name: `gregverse`
   - Dimension: `1536`
   - Metric: `cosine`
4. Copy your API key and environment from dashboard
5. Save them in Notes app temporarily

### 2. Upload Code to GitHub

#### Option A: GitHub Mobile App
1. Download GitHub mobile app from App Store
2. Login to your GitHub account
3. Create a new repository named "gregverse-backend"
4. Use the "+" button to upload the zip file I provided
5. Extract the files directly in the repository

#### Option B: GitHub Web Interface
1. Open Safari and go to github.com
2. Login to your account
3. Create a new repository named "gregverse-backend"
4. Use the "Add file" button to upload files
5. You'll need to upload the files one by one or in small batches

### 3. Deploy on Railway

1. Open Safari and go to railway.app
2. Sign up/login (you can use GitHub login)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Connect to your GitHub account if not already connected
6. Select your "gregverse-backend" repository
7. Add a PostgreSQL database:
   - Click "New"
   - Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"

### 4. Set Environment Variables

1. In your Railway project, go to "Variables" tab
2. Add the following variables:
   ```
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
   YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID=UCGy7SkBjcIAgTiwkXEtPnYg
   SECRET_KEY=any_random_string_like_abc123xyz789
   CORS_ORIGINS=*
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key_here
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment
   PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=gregverse
   ```
3. Tap "Save Changes"

### 5. Initialize Database

1. In Railway, go to your project dashboard
2. Tap on your service (should be named after your repo)
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Scroll down to "Shell" section
5. Tap "Open Shell"
6. Run these commands one by one:
   ```
   python scripts/init_db.py
   python scripts/sync_youtube_data.py
   python -c "from src.services.ai_chat_service import AIChatService; AIChatService().index_content(True)"
   ```

### 6. Connect to Your Frontend

1. In Railway, go to your project dashboard
2. Tap on your service
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Find your deployment URL (should be something like `https://gregverse-backend-production.up.railway.app`)
5. Use this URL as your API endpoint in your frontend

## üîç Testing Your Deployment

Open Safari and test these endpoints:

1. Health check: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
2. YouTube stats: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/stats/youtube`
3. API info: `https://your-app.railway.app/api`

## üìä Monitoring Your App

1. In Railway, go to your project dashboard
2. Tap on your service
3. Go to "Metrics" tab to see CPU, memory usage, etc.
4. Go to "Logs" tab to see application logs

## üîÑ Updating Your App

If you need to make changes:

1. Edit files directly on GitHub's web interface
2. Railway will automatically redeploy when you push changes
3. Or use working copy app on iPad for a better Git experience

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails:

1. Check Railway logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure PostgreSQL database is properly connected
4. Check if your API keys are valid

## üì± iPad-Friendly Tools

- **Working Copy**: Git client for iPad
- **Textastic**: Code editor for iPad
- **a-Shell**: Terminal emulator for iPad
- **Documents by Readdle**: File manager for iPad

These tools can make development on iPad easier, but they're optional for this deployment.
